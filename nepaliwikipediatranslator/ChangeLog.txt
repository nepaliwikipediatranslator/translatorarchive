Added Features to add Nouns
Adding nouns have eased so many puzzling things, Isolating verbs and nouns have made things easier.
Nouns have a different dimensions and specially the plurals get priorities and are more accurate.

Added Features to add Verbs
Adding verb feature was my long awaited concept. Initially I had a notion like adding dynamic rules.
I wished to generate rules dynamically during runtime, and on the fly by adding some sort of verb patterns and specifying verbs in a separate file.
Since I had a lot of patterns but most words used the same patterns and I was tired of typing all the patterns for all the words.

Since the rules file was more cluttered and getting bigger, I wished to separate the rules and put verbs in a separate verb file.
In this way it would look more clearer and simpler.



The rule file is still the masters.
####
To use a verb, one should define that this line contains a verb: 
(hiverb)+ति हैं|(neverb)+छ
(hiverb)+ति है|(neverb)+छ
(hiverb)+वाते हुए|(neverb)+ाउदा खेरि
(hiverb)+ता है|(neverb)+न्छ

####
To use a Noun, one should define that this line contains a Noun: 
eg: the following line demonstrates how to add a noun rule in the file : hinditonepali.txt
(hinoun)+ओं|(nenoun)+हरु

####
besides nouns are placed separately in a file called nounlist.txt
as: 
फेसबुक|फेसबुक
नंबर|नंबर
नीति|नीति
शब्द|शब्द

####
Similarly adjectives are placed in a file called adjectivelist.txt as follows:
सामने|अगाडी
जरूरत|जरूरत
संक्रामक|संक्रामक
मौजूद|मौजूद
वर्जित|वर्जित
देर|अबेर
संकेतक|संकेतक
पूरे|पुरा

####
The rules for adjectives are also kept in the main rule file as follows:
(hiadjective)+ है|(neadjective)+ छ
